Bootcamp: UPENN-VIRT-DATA-PT-06-2023-U-LOLC-MTTH Module 6 Challenge: Python API Challenge

# Description
This project is comprised of two Jupyter Notebooks: WeatherPy and VacationPy.

WeatherPy uses [citipy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) to generate a list of cities based on randomly generated longitudes and latitudes.
It then models weather data across these locations from [OpenWeatherMap](openweathermap.org).

VacationPy uses data collected and examined in WeatherPy.
It maps cities on a map using `hvplot`, then uses [Geoapify](geoapify.com) to collect the closest hotels to the coordinates generated in WeatherPy that fit specific criteria for weather conditions.

# Instructions
This project utilizes Jupyter.
It was created with Jupyter Lab but should run under Jupyter notebook as well.

It was written using the following program versions:

- Python 3.10.12
- jupyter_client 8.1.0
- jupyter_core 5.3.0

It requires the following packages:

- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy
- hvplot

# Credits
Data generated by [OpenWeatherMap](openweathermap.org) and [Geoapify](geoapify.com).
